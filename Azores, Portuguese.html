                    <h1>Azores, Portuguese</h1>

                    <p class="para">Azores, Portuguese in full Arquipélago dos Açores, archipelago and região autónoma (autonomous region) of Portugal. The chain lies in the North Atlantic Ocean roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 km) west of mainland Portugal. It includes nine major islands. The Azores are divided into three widely separated island groups: the eastern group, consisting of São Miguel, Santa Maria, and the Formigas islets; the central group, consisting of Faial, Pico, São Jorge, Terceira, and Graciosa; and the northwestern group, consisting of Flores and Corvo. The capital is Ponta Delgada on São Miguel.</p>
                <p class="para">The nearest continental land is Cape Roca, Portugal, which lies 875 miles (1,400 km) east of Santa Maria. The Azores, rising from the ocean atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, are in effect a major mountain range. The islands rise steeply from shores lined with rock and pebble debris (scree, or talus) to heights reaching 7,713 feet (2,351 metres) above sea level on Pico, the highest point in metropolitan Portugal. Their unstable geologic nature is indicated by numerous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. In 1522 the town of Vila Franca do Campo, then capital of São Miguel, was buried during a massive convulsion, and as recently as 1957–58 the Capelinhos eruption enlarged Faial. Indeed, many island houses are constructed of building blocks made of basalt. Deep craters (calderas) as well as lakes are a dramatic feature of the islands. On São Miguel the volcanic heat on the shores of Lake Furnas, a popular picnic spot, is sufficient for cooking.</p>
