                <p>Roughly 900 miles off the coast of Lisbon, this Portuguese archipelago can inspire wanderlust with a single photo. The verdant valleys, steep ocean-side cliffs, rows of blue hydrangeas, and scattering of waterfalls make the Azores a paradise worth exploring—just make sure you visit before everyone you know beats you to it.</p>

                <p>Venezuela overflows with natural wonders, including the world's highest waterfall: the 3,212-foot cascades of Angel Falls, located in the UNESCO-protected Canaima National Park. Canaima is by far the country's most popular attraction, and the falls stretch an astounding 19 times higher than Niagara Falls.</p>

                <p>With its gentle coastlines and transporting sunsets, it's easy to see why Boracay was voted one of the best islands in the world by our readers. Unfortunately, it's become overtouristed—the island closed for "rehabilitation" several years ago to compensate for overcrowding and unregulated development; it's since reopened to a limited number of visitors per day.</p>

                <p>Halong Bay, located in northeast Vietnam, is beloved for its blue waters and spread of limestone islands, all occupied by tropical trees and wildlife. Board a Chinese junk boat to experience the beauty—and associated myths and stories—of the mist-shrouded emerald basin for yourself.</p>

                <p>The seemingly endless stretches of lavender fields make Provence one of the prettiest (and best-smelling) places in France. Distilleries—where the essential oil from the flowers are bottled and used to make soaps, lotions, and creams—dot the area, but the multitude of fields featuring unreal violet views are the real pride of the region.</p>

                  Raja Ampat is a chain of some 1,500 islands off the western coast of West Papua. The views here are downright prehistoric: jagged lava peaks clad in green jungle; palms sprouting out of sheer cliff walls; mist drifting in and out of deep canyons. ."</p>
